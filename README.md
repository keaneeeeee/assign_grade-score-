# assign_grade
I wrote the code by creating a function assign_grade(score) that casts the input to an integer and verifies if it is in the valid range of 0 to 100. The function assigns grades on the basis of score ranges with the help of conditional statements and invalid inputs with error messages. I also tested the function with different inputs and provided user input for interactive grading.
